📌 Problem Statement

Farmers face huge losses due to delayed detection of crop diseases, lack of localized solutions, poor connectivity, and limited access to expert support.
The project addresses these issues by building an AI-based Smart Crop Disease Detection and Integrated Management System.

💡 Solution Overview

An AI-powered Digital Farming Assistant that integrates:

IoT Sensors → Real-time soil, environment, and plant health data.

AI/ML Models → Image-based disease detection, yield prediction, and risk alerts.

Cloud & Agentic AI → Scalable, multilingual, voice-assisted farmer support.

Market & Weather APIs → Real-time price updates and weather-based alerts.

🏗️ System Architecture
1. IoT Sensor Network Layer

Sensors monitor soil moisture, NPK, pH, EC, CO₂, temperature, humidity, plant health (via camera).

Detects stress before visible symptoms.

Data flows from field → IoT gateway (Raspberry Pi/ESP8266) → cloud → mobile app.

2. Data & Integration Layer

Firebase Realtime Database – sync & notifications.

SQLite – offline local storage.

External APIs:

OpenWeatherMap → weather risk alerts.

Agmarknet → market price updates.

Integrated sources: dealer databases, govt. schemes, crop calendars.

3. Intelligence Layer

On-device AI (PyTorch Mobile) for disease detection.

Cloud fallback (Vision APIs) for higher accuracy.

Decision Engine integrates: photo diagnosis, sensor data, weather forecasts.

Outputs: severity-based treatment plans & preventive recommendations.

4. User & Community Support Layer

Mobile App (Flutter/React Native) → multilingual + voice assistance.

Farmers upload photos, receive instant remedies, and alerts.

Community Forum → farmers share experiences.

Expert Support → agronomists validate low-confidence cases.

Continuous learning → AI retrains with farmer feedback & IoT data.
